# Evil Portal Template: 
## Free WiFi - Google & Facebook Login

Evil Portal creates fake login pages that mimic real captive portals on public WiFi networks. When users try to connect, they’re asked to enter credentials—often for social media or email accounts—to gain access. Once they do, their login details are captured, and their traffic can be intercepted, setting them up for further exploitation.

For this attack, we’ll simulate a public WiFi login page that requires users to sign in with Facebook or Google. When they enter their credentials, the password is logged, and their internet connection routes through the attacker's device. This not only gives access to their login details but also allows monitoring and manipulation of their traffic for further attacks.
